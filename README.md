# -Fillable-Lesson-2-Different-types-of-command-groups
The aim of this lesson is for programming members to recall what they learned in the "Commanding a motor to spin" lesson, and apply it with the new knowledge they have learned about command groups. 

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
1. Given four different commands, code at least two of them to show a working version of that type of command structor.

2. Recalling the previus assignment, bind at least two buttons on the controller to call the compleated commands.
